============================================

* <more to come, 0.7.2 hasn't been released yet>
* Added Java API documentation (doc/_static/java-apidoc)
* Added new diagnostic F_ERR flag to Java class PyLib.Diag
* Java class PyLib is no longer instantiable


Changes from version 0.7.0 to 0.7.1
===================================

* Updated README.txt and added MANIFEST.in after recognizing that the jpy-0.7.zip distribution misses most of the
  required source files and learning what to do on this case.
